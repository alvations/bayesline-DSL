The DSLCC comprises news data from various corpora to emulate the diverse news

== Format Description ==

The test data contains 3 files (including this README).
i. 		test.txt
ii. 	test-eng.txt
iii.	README

The test.txt contains 11,000 sentences from Group A-E.

All sentences are encoding in latin script UTF-8.

The test data only contain sentences without its language/variety group information.

== IMPORTANT ==

IMPORTANT!!! Please note the following to facilitate the evaluation:

(i) provide the system output as how the training and development data was 
formatted, without changing the order of the test sentences:
sentence<tab>group<tab>language

(ii) Please name your submission files with the following convention,
all in lowercase:
team_name-system_name-open_or_close-run#.txt

For example, if your team_name is "USAAR" , system_name is "DisLang" and it's an
open submission and it's the 1st run that you want to submit, the submission
file should be as such:
usaar-dislang-open-run1.txt

(iii) For Group F evaluation, please name your submission files with the following
convention, all in lowercase:
team_name-system_name-open_or_close-eng-run#.txt

For example, if your team_name is "USAAR" , system_name is "DisLang" and it's an
open submission and it's the 1st run that you want to submit, the submission
file should be as such:
usaar-dislang-open-eng-run1.txt

(iv) Along with the systems runs, submit a short description of your system.
This is to facilitate the description of the systems in the summary/finding 
paper for the shared task. 

(v) Please also compress ALL run submissions into a single file and send it to
dsl.sharedtask@gmail.com before the submission deadline (23 Apr), please name
