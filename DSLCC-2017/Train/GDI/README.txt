About the GDI transcriptions

The data contains 4 classes, with the following labels: BE, BS, LU and ZH

There is no widely spread convention for writing Swiss German. All instances have been transcribed using the writing system "Schwyzertütschi Dialäktschrift" proposed by Dieth (1986) to provide some guidance on how to write in a Swiss German dialect. The transcription is expected to show the phonetic properties of the variety but in a way that is legible for everybody who is familiar with standard German orthography (Dieth, 1986, 10). Dieth's system, which is originally phonemic, can be implemented in different ways depending on how differentiated the phonetic qualities are to be expressed. Although it is the objective to keep track of the pronunciation, Dieth's transcription method is orthographic and partially adapted to spelling habits in standard German. Therefore it does not provide the same precision and explicitness as phonetic transcription methods do. The transcriptions exclusively use lower case characters. Note that Dieth's system is hardly known by laymen, so that e.g. Swiss German data extracted from social media may look fairly different from our transcriptions.

In our transcriptions, we do not use the full power of phonemic distinctions available in the Dieth script. The grapheme inventory in the Dieth script is always related to the dialect and its phonetic properties, so that, for example, the grapheme <e> stands for different vowel qualities, [e], [ɛ] or [ə], depending on the dialect, the accentuation of the syllable and - to substantial degree - also to the dialectal background of the transcriber. Also, the practice in using Dieth's system changed over the time, so that some transcribers made more distinctions concerning the openness of vowels than others. For each dialect area, we include instances of several speakers and several transcribers.
